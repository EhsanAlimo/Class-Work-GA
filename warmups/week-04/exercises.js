// # Allergies Warmup

// An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for).

// The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

// - eggs (1)
// - peanuts (2)
// - shellfish (4)
// - strawberries (8)
// - tomatoes (16)
// - chocolate (32)
// - pollen (64)
// - cats (128)

// So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.
// If Mary has a score of 17, she must be allergic to tomatoes and eggs, but not peanuts or shellfish.

// Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:

// - Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.//////IT IS HAAAAAAAARDDDDDDDDD
// - All the allergens Tom is allergic to./////IT IS HAAAAAAAARDDDDDDDDD

//   1: "eggs",
//   2: "peanuts",
//   4: "shellfish",
//   8: "strawberries",
//   16: "tomatoes",
//   32: "chocolate",
//   64: "pollen",
//   128: "cats"
